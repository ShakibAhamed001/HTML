            My Facebook profile</a>dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
             scrambled 
             it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
            typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
             and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h1><u>Paragraph</u></h1>
        <h2>7th March Historical Speech</h2> 
        <p>7th March Speech is regarded as the most historical speech in Bangladesh which was delivered by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 
            on 7th March, 1971 at Ramna Race Course Maydan in Dhaka. About 2 million of people were present there. It was delivered during a 
            period of rising tensions between East Pakistan and the powerful political and military establishment of West Pakistan. In the speech, 
            Rahman proclaimed: “This time, the struggle is for our freedom. This time, the struggle is for our idependence.” The speech inspired the 
            Bangalees to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilization by West Pakistan and he called upon all 
            Bangalees of then East Pakistan to launch a significant struggle against the Pakistani occupation forces indicating for taking all-out 
            preparations for the War of Liberation. However, the speech effectively declared the independence of Bangladesh. The speech composes a
             faithful documentation of how the failure of post-colonial nation-states to develop inclusive, democratic society alienates their 
             population belonging to different ethnic, cultural, linguistic or religious groups. The speech of 7th March has inspired the whole 
             nation to take part in liberation war and free our country from the enemy. At the same way, this speech has touched the soul of every 
             Bangladeshi and even after 1971 this speech has encouraged and guided us to build up our nation. Really, it was an eye-opening 
             declaration for the nation. It’s a matter of great pride for us that UNESCO has recognized the speech and so now the whole world will
              know about the historic speech.</p>
